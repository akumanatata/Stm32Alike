# Stm32Alike
As the price of stm32Series went to sky,I think that, If we can construct new shells,Each of this shells could help us to use other Mcus(51、Msp430、MicroChip、etc..)
as the way to use STM32:
（1）We can program with STM32 firmwareLibs to build this project---->And even degbug Ok on a STM32 chip;
（2）Then Use the according shell to tran STM32proj into destination Mcu's Project format;---->After assemble tools' bulding and download to the accordding chip;
If we can do this,We will swicth from this-Series-Mcu to that-Series-Mcu Freedomly(with tiny cost of time,not a hardwork),It would be cool and save our time to do more
excting things!

I list serval destination mcu blew:
1.51seriels MCU,ForExample:STC8、STC12...(Broadly used in household electrical device、Industry device)
2.MSP430Series;（Broadlly used in Medical<or protable medical> Device）
3.MicroChips: PIC8Series、PIC16Series;
